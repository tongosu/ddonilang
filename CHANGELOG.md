# CHANGELOG.md

## Unreleased
- Added `tests/run_ci_sync_readiness_check_selftest.py`.
  - Verifies quick-mode (`--skip-aggregate`) pass path and JSON payload contract for `run_ci_sync_readiness_check.py`.
  - Verifies `--json-out` custom output path handling.
- Added `tests/run_ci_aggregate_gate_sync_diagnostics_check.py`.
  - Locks aggregate gate wiring for:
    - `ci_sync_readiness_selftest`
    - `ci_aggregate_gate_sync_diagnostics_check`
- Integrated sync-readiness selftest/diagnostics into aggregate gate.
  - `tests/run_ci_aggregate_gate.py` now runs:
    - `ci_sync_readiness_selftest`
    - `ci_aggregate_gate_sync_diagnostics_check`
  - Fast-fail / overall / sub-step failure conditions include both rc values.
- Added `tests/run_ci_sync_readiness_check.py` for one-command pre-sync verification.
  - Runs pipeline flag checks, their selftest, sanity diagnostics, sanity gate, and aggregate gate (unless `--skip-aggregate`).
  - Emits one-line status (`ci_sync_readiness_status=...`) and writes `ddn.ci.sync_readiness.v1` JSON report.
- Added `tests/run_ci_sanity_gate_diagnostics_check.py` to lock sanity-gate pipeline flag selftest wiring.
  - Verifies `run_ci_sanity_gate.py` keeps:
    - `pipeline_emit_flags_selftest`
    - `tests/run_ci_pipeline_emit_flags_check_selftest.py`
    - `E_CI_SANITY_PIPELINE_FLAGS_SELFTEST_FAIL`
- Integrated sanity-gate diagnostics into aggregate gate.
  - `tests/run_ci_aggregate_gate.py` now runs `ci_sanity_gate_diagnostics_check`.
  - Fast-fail / overall / sub-step failure conditions include the new diagnostics rc.
- Added `tests/run_ci_pipeline_emit_flags_check_selftest.py`.
  - Covers pass/fail scenarios for pipeline flag checker:
    - baseline pass
    - per-line required token missing
    - per-line forbidden token present
    - missing aggregate invocation line
- Wired pipeline flag checker selftest into CI gates.
  - `tests/run_ci_sanity_gate.py`: added `pipeline_emit_flags_selftest` step.
  - `tests/run_ci_aggregate_gate.py`: added `ci_pipeline_emit_flags_selftest` step (fast-fail/overall/sub-step failure wiring).
- Improved `tests/run_ci_pipeline_emit_flags_check.py` aggregate verification granularity.
  - Switched aggregate checks from whole-file token scan to per-invocation-line checks for `tests/run_ci_aggregate_gate.py`.
  - Required/forbidden checklist flags are now enforced on each aggregate command line.
- Added forbidden checklist-toggle guard in `tests/run_ci_pipeline_emit_flags_check.py`.
  - CI pipeline config now fails self-check if either token appears:
    - `--skip-5min-checklist`
    - `--with-5min-checklist`
  - This locks pipeline behavior to default checklist ON + explicit lightweight skips only.
- Pinned aggregate CI invocations to lightweight checklist mode in both pipeline configs.
  - Added `--checklist-skip-seed-cli --checklist-skip-ui-common` to
    - `.gitlab-ci.yml`
    - `azure-pipelines.yml`
- Updated `tests/run_ci_pipeline_emit_flags_check.py` to require both checklist skip flags so pipeline drift is caught by CI self-check.
- Switched `tests/run_ci_aggregate_gate.py` 5-minute checklist behavior to default ON.
  - Added `--skip-5min-checklist` as the explicit opt-out switch.
  - Kept `--with-5min-checklist` as a deprecated compatibility flag.
  - Aligned summary emission to use `include_5min_checklist` consistently.
- Extended `tests/run_ci_aggregate_gate_runtime5_diagnostics_check.py` to lock default-ON checklist tokens (`--skip-5min-checklist`, `include_5min_checklist`).
- Updated pendulum smoke golden hashes in `pack/seamgrim_curriculum_seed_smoke_v1/smoke_physics_pendulum.v1.json` to match the current tick-based seed runtime.
- Fixed AGE4 close blocker caused by stale seed smoke expected hashes (`seamgrim_curriculum_seed_smoke_v1` now passes).
- Refined aggregate runtime-checklist summary semantics in `tests/run_ci_aggregate_gate.py`:
  - when rewrite fallback item is not present (e.g., `--checklist-skip-seed-cli`), summary now reports `rewrite_status=not_executed` and `rewrite_ok=na`
  - added checklist report artifact path (`seamgrim_5min_checklist_report.detjson`) and automatic `--checklist-json-out` passthrough
- Added `tests/run_ci_aggregate_gate_runtime5_diagnostics_check.py` and wired it into aggregate gate diagnostics flow.
- Extended aggregate CI summary to surface runtime checklist details explicitly.
  - `tests/run_ci_aggregate_gate.py` now emits:
    - `seamgrim_5min_checklist`
    - `seamgrim_5min_checklist_ok`
    - `seamgrim_runtime_5min_rewrite_motion_projectile`
    - `seamgrim_runtime_5min_rewrite_elapsed_ms`
    - `seamgrim_runtime_5min_rewrite_status`
  - Added checklist report artifact path (`seamgrim_5min_checklist_report.detjson`) to aggregate report index.
  - Wired `--checklist-json-out` passthrough when `--with-5min-checklist` is enabled.

- Added `tests/run_seamgrim_motion_projectile_fallback_check.py` to lock observation-based bogae fallback coverage for rewrite physics lessons.
  - validates run-screen fallback tokens for `x/y` and `x`-only observation synthesis in `ui/screens/run.js`
  - runs `lessons_rewrite_v1/physics_motion` and `lessons_rewrite_v1/physics_projectile` via `teul-cli run --madi` and checks numeric progression sanity
- Wired the new step into `tests/run_seamgrim_runtime_5min_check.py` as `rewrite_motion_projectile_fallback`.
- Added checklist label mapping for the new fallback step in `tests/run_seamgrim_5min_checklist.py`.
- Converted `physics_pendulum_seed_v1` from batch `동안` integration to tick-by-tick (`매마디 1스텝`) integration.
- Updated `solutions/seamgrim_ui_mvp/seed_lessons_v1/physics_pendulum_seed_v1/lesson.ddn`:
  - initialize `t/theta/omega/energy` in `(시작)할때`
  - advance one Euler step per tick under `t <= t_max`
  - emit `(t,theta)/(t,omega)/(t,energy)` every tick
  - added explicit assignments outside `채비` for direct `teul-cli run` compatibility
- Added optional `madi` passthrough for server-side execution:
  - `solutions/seamgrim_ui_mvp/tools/export_graph.py`: `run_teul_cli(..., madi=None)`
  - `solutions/seamgrim_ui_mvp/tools/ddn_exec_server.py`: `/api/run` accepts payload `madi`
  - `solutions/seamgrim_ui_mvp/tools/ddn_exec_server_check.py`: pendulum validation run uses `madi=420`
- Reworked `tests/run_seamgrim_seed_pendulum_export_check.py` to validate real runtime progression via `teul-cli run --madi`.
- Added observation-based bogae fallback in run screen for pendulum-like lessons when native `space2d` output is absent.
- Updated `solutions/seamgrim_ui_mvp/ui/screens/run.js`:
  - synthesize minimal pendulum `seamgrim.space2d.v0` from observation keys (`theta`, optional `L`)
  - extend observation fallback to `x/y` (and `x`-only) lessons with a minimal point+axis `space2d` scene
  - keep native `views.space2d` precedence when available
  - align runtime snapshot status with synthesized `space2d`
- Added explicit pendulum simulation guarantees to Seamgrim runtime validation flows.
- Updated `solutions/seamgrim_ui_mvp/tools/ddn_exec_server_check.py` to execute `physics_pendulum_seed_v1` via `/api/run` and validate output sanity (point count, x-span, sign span).
- Added `tests/run_seamgrim_seed_pendulum_export_check.py` (new) to smoke-check pendulum seed graph export output.
- Added `seed_physics_pendulum_export` step to `tests/run_seamgrim_runtime_5min_check.py` (default non-skip path).
- Added checklist label mapping for the new pendulum step in `tests/run_seamgrim_5min_checklist.py`.
- Hardened `ddn_exec_server_check.py` path-candidate probing to swallow non-HTTP probe exceptions in fallback paths.

- Added `lastRunHash` persistence in run prefs and hash display on both browse card run hint and run topbar summary.
- Added browse card run-status badge colors (`최근성공/출력없음/최근실패/미실행`) for faster scan of lesson execution readiness.
- Added browse sort option `정렬: 최근 실행순` (`filter-sort=recent`) based on per-lesson `lastRunAt`.
- Added browse run-result filter (`filter-run-status`) with `성공/실패/미실행` options based on per-lesson run snapshots.
- Added run topbar recent summary label (`run-last-summary`) to keep latest lesson execution outcome visible during run.
- Added per-lesson run snapshot persistence (`lastRunKind`, `lastRunChannels`, `lastRunAt`, `lastRunStatus`) in `run.js` run prefs.
- Added browse-card recent-run hint (`최근 실행: ...`) so each lesson card shows latest execution readiness (space2d output/obs-only/empty/error).
- Added run failure snapshot capture (`kind=error`) and lesson-switch runtime snapshot reset to avoid cross-lesson stale hints.
- Added run-screen visibility lifecycle control so the WASM RAF loop only runs on the `run` screen and auto-pauses on `browse`/`editor`.
- Added runtime output diagnostics in `ui/screens/run.js`:
  - `WASM 실행됨 · 출력 없음 (채널=0 · 보개 없음)`
  - `WASM 실행됨 · 보개 출력 없음 (채널=N · 그래프/표 확인)`
  - `WASM 실행 중 · 보개 출력 · 채널=N`
- Kept `run_wasm_single_path` gate token compatibility by preserving `this.setStatus("실행 상태: WASM 실행 중")` in restart success path.
- Added 3-slot range preset support for both Bogae and Graph (`slot 1/2/3` selectors + per-slot save/load) with legacy slot-1 fallback compatibility.
- Added browse-card run-state hint from local prefs (`축잠금 ON` / `축잠금 OFF · x:... y:...`) and live refresh via `seamgrim:run-prefs-changed` event.
- Added persistent per-lesson run UI prefs for preset slot selections (`selectedBogaePresetSlot`, `selectedGraphPresetSlot`).
- Added UI gate tokens for preset slot selectors (`bogae-preset-slot`, `graph-preset-slot`).
- Added preferred-axis lock toggle in run graph toolbar (`btn-axis-lock`) to switch between lesson-default axis lock and manual X/Y axis selection.
- Added localStorage-backed run UI session restore (`seamgrim.ui.run_prefs.v1`) for per-lesson selected axes and saved range presets (graph/bogae).
- Added Dotbogi axis APIs for session persistence (`getSelectedAxes`, `setSelectedAxes`, `setPreferredAxisLock`) and disabled selectors while axis lock is ON.
- Added UI gate token for axis lock control (`btn-axis-lock`) in `tests/run_seamgrim_ui_age3_gate.py`.
- Added X-axis selector to Dotbogi graph toolbar (`select-x-axis`) with `index` fallback and variable-based X plotting.
- Added default X-axis preference parsing in `control_parser` (`#기본관찰x/#기본관측x` and `default_x*` aliases), plus inline `기본관찰x` hints in `채비` variable declarations.
- Added preferred-axis labeling in dropdowns: preferred Y/X keys are shown as `(<key> (기본))` in selectors.
- Wired lesson load path to apply both preferred axes (`defaultAxisKey`, `defaultXAxisKey`) from parsed DDN metadata.
- Added default Y-axis preference wiring for Dotbogi: `#기본관찰`/`#기본관측` (and `default_obs` aliases) now set `defaultAxisKey` via `control_parser` and are applied on lesson load.
- Added `DotbogiPanel.setPreferredYKey()` and selection fallback policy: preferred variable first, then first observable key.
- Added parser support for inline default-observation hints on variable declarations in `채비` blocks and regression checks in `tests/seamgrim_ui_common_runner.mjs`.
- Enforced control parsing split in `ui/components/control_parser.js`: only constant-like `채비/#control` entries become sliders, while variable-like entries are emitted as axis keys.
- Applied explicit `#control` precedence over `채비` auto-inference for slider specs (DDN self-contained control contract alignment).
- Added parser regression assertions in `tests/seamgrim_ui_common_runner.mjs` for constant/variable separation and `#control` priority.
- Added one-slot range presets in run UI (`보개 저장/불러오기`, `축 저장/불러오기`) and wired them in `ui/screens/run.js`.
- Added graph/bogae numeric range controls in the run screen (`index.html`, `styles.css`) with apply/reset actions for fixed axis/view testing.
- Extended `ui/components/dotbogi.js` with explicit axis APIs (`getCurrentAxis`, `setAxis`, `resetAxis`) and axis normalization for manual range application.
- Extended `ui/components/bogae.js` with range APIs (`getCurrentRange`, `setRange`) and range-change callbacks to keep UI controls synchronized.
- Wired `ui/screens/run.js` to synchronize range inputs with mouse/keyboard zoom-pan state, validate numeric range input, and apply/reset graph/bogae ranges without server fallback.
- Reduced noisy lesson asset 404s by adding catalog path preference caching in `ui/app.js` (reuse last successful root/project path).
- Added optional Nginx reverse-proxy deploy template (`deploy/nginx/seamgrim.conf`) with explicit `application/wasm` MIME handling.
- Extended `tests/run_seamgrim_deploy_artifacts_check.py` to enforce nginx template presence/tokens and deploy README nginx guidance.
- Strengthened `ddn_exec_server_check.py` with runtime checks for lesson/seed/rewrite manifest accessibility, representative lesson asset fetches, and WASM MIME validation (`application/wasm`).
- Added `ddn_exec_server_check` execution step to `tests/run_seamgrim_ci_gate.py` and extended diagnostics self-check coverage.
- Hardened Seamgrim UI lesson/sample path loading with catalog fallback resolution (`/…` <-> `/solutions/seamgrim_ui_mvp/…`) to prevent manifest/asset 404s across server layouts.
- Added `tests/run_seamgrim_lesson_path_fallback_check.py` and wired `lesson_path_fallback` into `tests/run_seamgrim_ci_gate.py`.
- Added GitHub branch-protection config (`.github/branch-protection/main.required_checks.json`) and automation script (`tools/scripts/apply_github_branch_protection.py`) for enforcing `seamgrim-gate` required checks.
- Added `tests/run_seamgrim_workflow_contract_check.py` and wired a new `workflow_contract` step into `tests/run_seamgrim_ci_gate.py` to lock workflow job/context drift.
- Extended `.github/workflows/seamgrim-ci.yml` path filters to include `.github/branch-protection/**`.
- Added Docker deploy artifacts for Seamgrim DDN exec server (`deploy/Dockerfile`, `deploy/docker-compose.yml`) and health/base-url checks.
- Added `tests/run_seamgrim_deploy_artifacts_check.py` and wired `deploy_artifacts` into `run_seamgrim_ci_gate.py`.
